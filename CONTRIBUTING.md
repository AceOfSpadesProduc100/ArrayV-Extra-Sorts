# Contributing to the Extra Sorts Pack

To contribute to this repo, you should set up a development environment. We currently guarantee support with the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/) IDEs (we plan to resolve this limitation in the near future).

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Do *not* download the ZIP of this repo from GitHub, as that does not include the ArrayV submodule, which is required. However, GitHub Desktop does include the submodule, so using that *will* work!

To get started, you need to clone the GitHub repository itself:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Gaming32/ArrayV-Extra-Sorts
```

Once you have done this, simply open the ArrayV-Extra-Sorts folder/project in your IDE of choice.
